### 1. Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

**Data Structures** are ways to organize and store data to make it easy to access and modify. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs.

**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. Examples include sorting algorithms (like bubble sort, quick sort) and searching algorithms (like binary search).

### 2. Big-O Notation

Big-O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time
- **O(nÂ²)**: Quadratic time

### 3. Basic Data Structures

#### Arrays
Arrays are collections of elements identified by index or key. They are a fundamental part of most programming languages.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(arr[0]); // Output: 1
```

#### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }
  
  // Add a node at the end
  append(data) {
    let newNode = new Node(data);
    if (this.head === null) {
      this.head = newNode;
    } else {
      let current = this.head;
      while (current.next) {
        current = current.next;
      }
      current.next = newNode;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Stacks
A stack is a collection of elements with two principal operations: push (adds an element to the collection) and pop (removes the most recently added element).

```javascript
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  push(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.items.length == 0) return "Underflow";
    return this.items.pop();
  }
}
```

#### Queues
A queue is a collection of elements supporting two principal operations: enqueue (adds an element to the end) and dequeue (removes the first element).

```javascript
class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  enqueue(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  dequeue() {
    if (this.items.length == 0) return "Underflow";
    return this.items.shift();
  }
}
```

#### Hash Tables
A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

```javascript
class HashTable {
  constructor() {
    this.table = new Array(137);
  }

  // Simple hash function
  hash(string) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
      total += string.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return total % this.table.length;
  }

  add(key, value) {
    const index = this.hash(key);
    this.table[index] = value;
  }

  get(key) {
    const index = this.hash(key);
    return this.table[index];
  }
}
```

### 4. Advanced Data Structures

#### Trees
A tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

#### Graphs
A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It can be used to represent various real-world structures, like networks, paths, etc.

#### Heaps
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is used to implement priority queues.

### 5. Basic Algorithms

#### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

#### Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

### 6. Advanced Algorithms

#### Graph Algorithms
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

#### Dynamic Programming
- **Fibonacci Sequence**
- **Knapsack Problem**
